## 🎯 **CORE APPLICATION FILES**

### **1. `app.py` - Main Streamlit Application (432 lines)**
**Purpose**: The heart of the application - user interface and workflow orchestration

**Key Components**:
- **CSV Upload & Validation**: Handles file upload with comprehensive error checking
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and validates uploaded data automatically
- **Scoring Integration**: Applies LeadScorer to uploaded data
- **Interactive Display**: Color-coded table with filtering options
- **Outreach Generation**: Personalized templates for high-priority leads
- **Export Functionality**: Multiple download formats (complete, high-priority, summary)
- **Pro Tips Sidebar**: User guidance and best practices

**Core Logic Flow**:
```python
1. File Upload → 2. Validate CSV → 3. Clean Data → 4. Score Leads → 
5. Display Results → 6. Generate Outreach → 7. Export Options
```

**Key Functions**:
- `validate_csv_data()`: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
- `apply_score_styling()`: Color-codes leads (Green/Yellow/Red)
- `create_sample_csv()`: Generates template for users

**Technical Details**:
```python
# CSV Validation Logic
required_columns = ['name', 'email', 'company', 'job_title', 'company_size']
missing_columns = [col for col in required_columns if col not in df.columns]

# Email Format Validation
email_pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
return bool(re.match(email_pattern, str(email).strip()))

# Data Cleaning Process
df_clean = df.dropna(how='all')  # Remove empty rows
df_clean['name'] = df_clean['name'].fillna('Unknown')
df_clean['company'] = df_clean['company'].fillna('Unknown Company')
```

**UI Features**:
- Sidebar with Pro Tips (6 actionable recommendations)
- Progress spinners during processing
- Export confirmation messages
- Contextual help when no high-priority leads found
- Color-coded priority display with filtering

### **2. `scoring_engine.py` - Lead Scoring Engine (250 lines)**
**Purpose**: Modular scoring system with ML-ready architecture

**Key Components**:
- **LeadScorer Class**: Main scoring interface
- **Normalization Methods**: Handle real-world data variations
- **Rule-Based Logic**: Current scoring implementation
- **ML Placeholder**: Ready for future model integration

**Scoring Logic**:
```python
Points System:
- Senior Job Titles (Manager, Director, VP, CEO): +2 points
- C-Level Executive Bonus: +1 point  
- Corporate Email (not Gmail/Yahoo): +1 point
- Large Company (>100 employees): +2 points
- Medium Company (25-100 employees): +1 point

Final Mapping:
- ≥5 points = "High" Priority
- 3-4 points = "Medium" Priority  
- 1-2 points = "Medium" Priority
- 0 points = "Low" Priority
```

**Normalization Features**:
- **Job Titles**: Handles abbreviations (Sr. → Senior, VP → Vice President)
  ```python
  job_title_mappings = {
      'mgr': 'manager', 'sr': 'senior', 'vp': 'vice president',
      'ceo': 'chief executive officer', 'dir': 'director',
      'evp': 'executive vice president', 'svp': 'senior vice president'
  }
  ```

- **Company Sizes**: Processes text ("Startup" → 5), ranges ("50-100" → 50)
  ```python
  size_mappings = {
      'startup': 5, 'small': 10, 'medium': 50, 'large': 200,
      'enterprise': 1000, 'freelance': 1, 'solo': 1
  }
  ```

- **Email Domains**: Extracts and normalizes domains for corporate detection
  ```python
  personal_domains = [
      'gmail.com', 'yahoo.com', 'hotmail.com', 'outlook.com',
      'icloud.com', 'live.com', 'protonmail.com', 'yandex.com'
  ]
  ```

**ML-Ready Architecture**:
```python
def score_lead(self, lead: dict, mode="rule"):
    if mode == "rule":
        return self._rule_based_score(lead)
    elif mode == "ml":
        # Future ML model integration - no API changes needed
        return self._ml_model_score(lead)
```

1. **Professional Introduction**: Formal, relationship-building approach
   ```
   Hi {Name},
   
   I hope this message finds you well. I came across {Company} and was 
   impressed by your work in the industry.
   
   As someone in your position, I imagine you're focused on {Goal}...
   ```

2. **Value Proposition**: ROI-focused with metrics
   ```
   Hello {Name},
   
   I noticed {Company} is in a growth phase, and I wanted to reach out 
   with a quick idea.
   
   We've helped companies like yours increase {Goal} by 25-40%...
   ```

3. **Problem-Solving**: Consultative, insight-driven approach
   ```
   Hi {Name},
   
   I've been researching {Company} and the challenges facing your industry. 
   Many leaders in similar positions are struggling with {Goal}...
   ```

**Goal Mapping Logic**:
```python
def determine_goal_from_title(job_title):
    job_title_lower = job_title.lower()
    
    # Sales-focused roles
    if any(word in job_title_lower for word in ['sales', 'revenue', 'business development']):
        return "revenue growth"
    
    # Marketing-focused roles  
    elif any(word in job_title_lower for word in ['marketing', 'brand', 'digital']):
        return "lead generation"
    
    # Executive roles
    elif any(word in job_title_lower for word in ['ceo', 'president', 'founder', 'chief']):
        return "strategic growth"
    
    # Technology roles
    elif any(word in job_title_lower for word in ['tech', 'it', 'engineer', 'developer']):
        return "technical optimization"
    
    # Operations roles
    elif any(word in job_title_lower for word in ['operations', 'manager', 'director']):
        return "operational efficiency"
```

**Personalization Process**:
```python
def generate_personalized_content(lead_data, content_type="both"):
    name = lead_data.get('name', 'there')
    company = lead_data.get('company', 'your company')
    job_title = lead_data.get('job_title', '')
    
    # Determine appropriate goal based on job title
    goal = determine_goal_from_title(job_title)
    
    # Apply personalization
    personalized_content = template.format(
        Name=name, Company=company, Goal=goal
    )
```
